# Welcome!

These files are some samples of my work taken from my private repositories. They are not indended to be run as standalone programs, but rather serve as an example of how I write code.

`DeviceManager.py` - Part of a robotics project. This file interacts with a USB to serial connector to drive various motors.

`FPGAProgram.c` - This is a high-level program to interact with a custom SoC FPGA hardware design.

`bare-metal-mcu.c` - This is a bare-metal program written for an MSP430 microcontroller.

`myPWM.vhd` - A hardware specification for a custom FPGA PWM component.

Here is a sample website:
